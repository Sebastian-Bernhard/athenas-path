    {-
    type signature: (Integral a) => a -> String
    The function takes an argument of type a.
    It produces a String as output.
    a must belong to the type class Integral.

    type constraint: (Integral a)
    Restricts the type variable a to only types that are instances of the Integral type class. Representing whole numbers, like fixed-size integers (Int) and arbitrary-precision integers (Integer).
