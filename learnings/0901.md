- error handling with maybe e.g.
    
        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a 
        describe :: Maybe Int -> String 
        describe Nothing  = "Nothing here" 
        describe (Just n) = "Just a number"

- pattern matching, matching the specific constructors of the Maybe type
extract the calue of the Just constructor
a could be any tyoe, but all occurences of a need to have the same type

- reading and printing a command line argument
- let, bindings to create functions by naming arguments after the identifier

- writing a pure library for a cli tool
