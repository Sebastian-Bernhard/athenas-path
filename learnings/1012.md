- structure of a haskell projekt, modules and their importing

Tales of Mystery and Imagination, learning Haskell
- the level of abstraction used by Haskell, needs code examples
- type inference, type expressions, value expression, semantic expression
- on evaluation, a semantic expression must produce some value
- data structures: list, tuple
- lists are polymorphic, tuples are unit type
- haskell uses the less sepecific type to represent numbers (e.g.)
    ```
    ghci> t = () :: () \
    ghci> t = (1,1.1) \
    ghci> :t t \
    t :: (Fractional b, Num a) => (a, b)
    ```
- functions are datatypes, functions are, and evaluate to, values
- anonymous functions written as lambda abstraction e.g.
- nested expressions like `add = \x -> \y -> x + y`
