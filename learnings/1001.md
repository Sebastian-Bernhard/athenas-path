Learning

- handling optional values with Maybe
- using higher order functions that receive predictes on when to increment certen fuctions
- thinking about hidden fuctions, by creating a local function definition inside our function

        let 
        var1 = var 2 + 1
        var2 = 100
        func a b = a + b
        in
        func var1 var2

- locally created functions extend the type signature
- Lambda Functions
